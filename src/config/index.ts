      "A Fullstack Developer, which have journey began at the end of 2022 after finishing high school. Back then, I only knew a little about IT and thought it was mainly about designing websites. That changed when I joined RUPP in 2023 to study Computer Science. In the beginning, I had to learn many orientation subjects, which was quite challenging. But by my second year, the focus shifted more toward core IT subjects, and thatâ€™s when I truly found my passion. I explored UX/UI design with Adobe XD and Figma, studied web design, and even built a full-stack POS system with mentorship from senior students working at the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). Later, I passed an internship as a Frontend Developer at the end of my second year at a startup company base in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Where I gained real-world experience. Today, Iâ€™m working as a Backend Developer, building RESTful APIs and continuing to grow my skills in backend development.",
