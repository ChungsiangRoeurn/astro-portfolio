My journey began with frontend development, where I developed a solid foundation in building intuitive user interfaces using tools like React and Tailwind CSS. Over time, my curiosity and desire to understand the full development lifecycle led me to backend development. I now specialize in building scalable and secure RESTful APIs using NestJS and TypeScript. I'm passionate about problem-solving, system design, and creating software that improves lives. I continuously strive to improve my skills, collaborate with like-minded developers, and contribute to meaningful, production-ready applications that make a difference.",
